# Demo of PowerShell download and run directly from GitHub
# Note, from a security point of view this is a really bad idea, you shouldn't run code
# before reviewing it carefully and understanding it, and anyone who has access to the 
# GitHub repo could  change the code at any time 
# (which is a benefit for updating, but a risk for running it)

# Anyway, don't do it. This is just a proof of concept :-)

# Invoke-Expression $($ScriptFromGithHub.Content)
